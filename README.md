# HR_report_fill
An example of automating filling in a Word report form with data from Excel file and Pandas

The idea for writing this is after reading the AUTOMATE THE BORING STUFF book.
I am an HR manager and my job partly consists of preparing a wide variety of reports for management, government and statistics.
I've already become a pro in Excel in VBA, but I really like programming and the Python language.
So I decided to automate a bit of the boring job of reporting my department's performance to senior management.
Previously, you had to do this:
Due to the fact that I do not have direct access to the database, at first I had to generate 
a ready-made report (xls file (the time of formation by the program is 1 minute) and then work with it 
(but I have an idea and understanding of how to write the required SQL query , to unload this information from the database), 
open data on people, make pivot tables, remove unnecessary things, copy to Word (do not ask why))) and then print and sign. 
On average, if not distracted, it took about 20 minutes.

Now life has become much easier and better))). 
I got new knowledge, skills and abilities. 
And I get the finished report in 0.5 seconds, taking into account the time to save the original xls file - 1 minute and 0.5 seconds.


P.S. I'm understand that junior's level and this file not all in PEP rules. 
But i'm write his file with maximum readability to whom who will want repeat this in their work
and of course automete the boring stuff  :)
